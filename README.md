# Bitreserve Python SDK

Welcome to the Bitreserve SDK for Python developers. Using this library, developers can more easily 
get started using the [Bitreserve API](http://developers.bitreserve.org/api/v1/). 

## Getting Started

To begin, visit the [Bitreserve website](http://bitreserve.org/) and create an account. With a 
username and password in hand, you can begin building apps against the Bitreserve API immediately. 

## Authentication

Bitreserve utilizes OAuth2 for authentication. Right now, Bitreserve requires passing a username 
and password via the API to obtain a User Authentication Token (UAT). The python SDK eliminates much
of the need to worry about such details though. Here is an example of how to authenticate using 
the Python SDK:

    from bitreserve import Bitreserve
    api = Bitreserve()
    api.auth( <username>, <password> )
    me = api.get_me()

*In the future, Bitreserve will support additional means of authentication that do not require the 
direct use of a username and password hard coded in software or config files.*

## Example: Sending a Transaction

Below is an example of how one would send 1 BTC to someone using Bitreserve:

    card_id = 'adc869d8-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-72718f0a2be0'
    from bitreserve import Bitreserve
    api = Bitreserve()
    api.auth( <username>, <password> )
    promise = api.prepare_txn( card_id, 'luke@skywalker.net', 1, 'BTC' )
    api.execute_txn( card_id, 'luke@skywalker.net', 1, 'BTC', promise )

A couple of notes about the sample above:

* A card ID is required to identify from which store of value you will be sending value from.

* One may specify sending any amount in any denomination. If an exchange is implied, Bitreserve
  will handle the exchange for you automatically.

* When sending money via Bitreserve, you can specify a recipient in the form of a bitcoin address,
  an email address, or a Bitreserve member name.

* Obtaining a "promise" is helpful when a transaction involves an exchange of value from one form
  or another. This promise secures a quote for the transaction which Bitreserve will honor for 30
  seconds. Obtaining a promise is *not* required.

*For a complete reference to the Bitreserve API, including examples in Python, please consult 
the [Bitreserve API documentation](http://developers.bitreserve.org/).*
